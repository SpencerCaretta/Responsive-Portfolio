            <!--Paragraph describing a bit about myself plus a list of my hobbies-->
            <p>Hi!  Welcome to my very first portfolio displaying my progress as a coder.  I am currently a student at the UMN Coding Boot Camp, and I am hoping to learn lots about creating websites, web applications and possibly mobile applications.  I originally obtained a bachelor's of science in psychology from the University of Minnesota.  I am currently working at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis as a Psychiatric Associate in a mental health unit with children/adolescents.</p>
            <p>I hope to use the knowledge obtained in this coding boot camp, Google Fu, technical interviewing skills and networking in order to obtain a job working as a website developer.  I do not currently have any specific companies that I want to work for, but throughout this course, I plan on researching different companies to find a job that is the right fit for me.  I plan on going the extra mile whenever possible for me in order to make myself the best candidate for whichever jobs I pursue. Besides coding, there are lots of other things I like to do.  Below, I have listed just a few of those things.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Running (I am training for the Twin Cities Marathon.)</li>
                <li>Playing Card Games of all sorts</li>
                <li>Kayaking</li>
                <li>Walking with Dogs</li>
                <li>Playing Video Games</li>
            </ul>
